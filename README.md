# WHY ME
https://jesababon.github.io/whyme

An argument for a jr dev using design.cms.gov.

## CMS Designs

Utilized instructions at design.cms.gov to import css standards.

### Image Loading with File-Loader and React

CMS standard images loaded using webpack.config.js and file-loader.

Change hard-coded svg colors to "currentColor" so they inhert from cms components.

### React Rendering

Rendering pages as components and modularizing functionality as passed functions using react-router-dom.

### Accessibility

Considered accessibility standards using react-axe.
